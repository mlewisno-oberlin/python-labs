Lab04 requires the use of a picture class, which you might have already used in lab03.

So make sure you get the picture.py file in this folder before starting the lab.

You need to put picture.py in the same folder with your lab files,

and do "from picture import Picture" where you need it.

The current picture class might not be perfect and require changes later,

so if you have any suggestions for improvement or want to report a bug, 

shoot me an email to szheng@oberlin.edu.



Also, to use picture.py you need to install PIL(Python Image Library) first.

For platforms other than Windows, you can download PIL from 

https://github.com/peter-fogg/pil-py3k/tree/master/PIL 

In the command line, go into your PIL folder, and then do "python setup.py install".

If you are using Windows, a simpler way to install PIL will be to use the .exe file from 

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pil

If you have problems installing PIL, feel free to email me at szheng@oberlin.edu.
